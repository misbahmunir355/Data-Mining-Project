**Predicting Housing Prices and Classification with Explainable AI: A Comprehensive Project Report**

We've completed a project on predicting housing prices and classification using regression and classification models. Our team's comprehensive approach included data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, with a focus on interpretability using LIME and SHAP.

In this project, we implemented various regression and classification models to predict housing prices and classify them into categories. Our comprehensive approach involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation with detailed explanations using LIME and SHAP for interpretability.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data Preprocessing: We handled missing values, removed duplicates, converted data types, created price categories, managed outliers, and calculated the age of houses.
- Feature Selection: Utilized backward elimination to select the most significant features.
- Data Visualization: Generated scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand data relationships.

**Regression Models:**
1. Linear Regression: Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
2. Ridge Regression: Created polynomial features and used regularization.
3. Lasso Regression: Implemented with hyperparameter tuning.
4. KNN Regressor: Performed hyperparameter tuning and evaluated with MSE.

**Classification Models:**
1. Multinomial Logistic Regression: Evaluated with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
2. XGBoost Classifier: Implemented with hyperparameter tuning and evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix.
3. Random Forest Classifier: Evaluated with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier: Evaluated similarly to the Random Forest.

** Explainable AI:**
- LIME: Explained model predictions for individual instances.
- SHAP: Calculated and visualized feature importance for model predictions.
